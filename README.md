# Gottfrids Tavelbutik

This project was developed as a school project at Medieinstitutet. 

The aim was to create a webshop for donuts or another product of choice. 
I chose to create a webshop for Canvases I've created in photoshop a few years ago to make it a little bit more personal. 

Troughtout this project I focused on understanding the basics of Java Script and I'm excited to redo this projects in a few years. This is my first project so I consider it to be the most important one. I hope you enjoy.

## Lessons Learned

Since this was my first project I've learned some lessons of the basics in JavaScript. 

* Keep good structure
* It matter where you write the code
* It's better to use global variables 
* Write psuedocode before you start to code

Writing pseudocode was difficult for me since everything was a new experience, but for the next project I think it will be very helpful.
